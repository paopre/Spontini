# Editor configuration

Many options of Spontini-Editor can be configured and their configuration is permanently saved. Configuration parameters are grouped into two distinct files and their names are (...I hope so...) self-explanatory:

  1. **saved-config.txt** (inside the "lib" directory)
  2. **[global-custom-vars.js](../lib/webgui/js/global-custom-vars.js)**

All the options inside **[global-custom-vars.js](../lib/webgui/js/global-custom-vars.js)** are mostly layout options and they should be changed **only if really necessary** (in any case: note that this is a js "core" file, and any bad configuration will prevent the editor to work)
  
All the options inside **saved-config.txt** can be set with the Spontini-Server GUI or the Spontini-Editor GUI; if they are not exposed by these two GUIs, they can be edited:

  1. By manually modifying the previous file.
  2. By sending to the web server, on the /cgi subaddress, a POST request with a JSON content in the form:
  
  ```
  {cmd: "SET_CONFIG_PARAM", param1: "param-name", param2: "value"}
  ```
  
  If you use **[curl](https://curl.se/)**, a complete command could be, for example:
  
  ```
  curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST --data '{"cmd":"SET_CONFIG_PARAM","param1":"debug","param2":"yes"}' \
  http://localhost:8000/cgi
  ```
  
  After a configuration parameter is set, restart the web server.
