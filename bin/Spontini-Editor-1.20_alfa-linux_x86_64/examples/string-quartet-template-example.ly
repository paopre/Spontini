% Taken from:

%
% This example shows how parts can be automatically managed.
% Play with parts by moving them inline/included with:
%
%   TOOLS ---> Make all __BLOCK__s included
%   TOOLS ---> Make all __BLOCK__s inline
%   TOOLS ---> Make __BLOCK__ included
%   TOOLS ---> Make __BLOCK__ inline
%
% When using "Make __BLOCK__ included/inline", the name of the wanted block will be asked:
% it corresponds to the string soon after "__BLOCK__" token, for example: "string-quartet-template_violinOne".
% Note too that:
%   1) jssvg editing is disabled for all the included blocks.
%   2) when making a block included, a string in the form "maxjssvgid=NUM" will be added to the block.
%      DON'T REMOVE IT MANUALLY! This string stores the value of the max generated ID of the \jsXXX functions
%      inside the included block, and the editor will use it for generating the next useful ID for any new added \jsXXX function.
